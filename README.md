A Bot to watch for Kleros Governor events and respond with notifications and transactions.

## Description

> Words in ALL_CAPS are environment variables. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for more information on them.

This software consists of 5 modules that monitor the state of an instance of Kleros Governor:

### 1. Execute Approved
Executes approved transactions in the previous session.

### 2. No List
Monitors submitted lists for the current session. If none of the submitters (SUBMITTER_ADDRESSES) made a submission during the first half of the session, this module will send emails to the watchers (WATCHERS) more and more frequently until either:
- One of the submitters (SUBMITTER_ADDRESSES) submits a list;
- One of the submitters (SUBMITTER_ADDRESSES) disarms the alarm.

### 3. Pass Period
If the submission period of the current session is over is not marked as disputed, the bot will submit a transaction to execute submissions:
- If no one made a submission, it will move the governor to the next session.
- If there is only one submitted list, it will mark it as approved and move the contract to the next session.
- If there is more than one submission, it will raise a dispute.

### 4. Submit List
If we are approaching the end of the submission period (LIST_SUBMISSION_THRESHOLD_SECONDS) and none of the submitters (SUBMITTER_ADDRESSES) made a submission, the bot will submit an empty list.
> This will raise a dispute if someone made a submission.

> The bot's wallet needs to have enough ETH to pay for gas + the submission deposit.

### 5. Alarm UI
The Alarm UI allows the submitters to disarm the alarm for the current session. A web3 enabled browser is required.
